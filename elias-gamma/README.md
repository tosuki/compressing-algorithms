# Compression Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data compression algorithms. 

There are many different techniques available for compressing data, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases. The purpose of this repository is to explore and study these algorithms in practice â€” to understand how they work, where they perform best, and when they should be used.

By implementing and experimenting with different approaches, the goal is to build a deeper understanding of compression methods from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
